48 continuous real [0,100] features of type word_freq_WORD 
= percentage of words in the e-mail that match WORD, i.e. 100 * (number of times the WORD appears in the e-mail) / total number of words in e-mail. A "word" in this case is any string of alphanumeric characters bounded by non-alphanumeric characters or end-of-string. 

6 continuous real [0,100] features of type char_freq_CHAR] 
= percentage of characters in the e-mail that match CHAR, i.e. 100 * (number of CHAR occurrences) / total characters in e-mail

1 continuous integer [1,...] attribute of type capital_run_length_total
